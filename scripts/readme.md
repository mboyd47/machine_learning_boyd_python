Data preparation was completed in the data_process.py file. There was one record missing an outcome that was dropped from the data. All missing values in the features were filled with the median for each feature. After investigating each featureâ€™s distribution by outcome, 21 variables that did not show much variance between the two outcome classes were dropped from the dataset. One new feature was created based on its distribution between outcome classes: heart rate^2. A correlation matrix was generated for the remaining features to determine if there were any highly correlated pairs that could be used to engineer new features. Using a threshold of 0.50 absolute correlation or greater, four new features were created based on the highly correlated pairs found in the matrix: MCH * MCV, MCHC * MCH, Blood sodium * Chloride, and Anion gap * Creatinine. 

Classifier models were created in the models.py file. The data was split 25% for testing and 75% for training with random state 444. The models created were Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Gradient Boosting.
